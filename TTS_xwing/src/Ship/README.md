# Ship

This directory contains the scripts for the Ships.

I think this would be best suited toward things that ships have or can do,
not necessary scripts which operate on Ships, which might go best under
`Game.Mechanic`.

Currently, Ships can:
* Deploy (Devices or Shuttles)
* Maneuver (Move)
 
Have Modifications like
* Turret
